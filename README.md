# VibeLight (with ESP8266)

This project is the improved concept of the [VibeLight Gateway](https://github.com/bastianraschke/vibelightgateway). It uses a small Arduino compatible ESP8266 chip (in my case a NodeMCU board) to provide a Wifi connected distributed ambiance light system. The device communicates with a MQTT server (in my case [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)) to receive commands to control arbitrary light effects. You can install nearly any amount of light devices in your room.

In this enhanced version the VibeLight system uses a native iOS app developed in Swift programming language. You can open the project with Xcode to deploy the app to your iOS device.
